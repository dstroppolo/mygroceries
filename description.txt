Grocery Store prices

I have scraped a couple of grocery store's websites to get the prices of all the items they have listed online. Included information is:

- Name
- Brand
- URL
- Image URL
- Sale Price (if exists)
- Regular Price
- Weight/Size (g or ml)
- Unit Size
- Barcode Value (same across all stores)
- Category

Functionality
- Get all products by store (paginated)
- Get all products by category (paginated)
- Get product by barcode
- Get products on sale
- Scan a barcode to get the items
- Manually enter a barcode to get the item

API
- api/products?store={storeName}&limit=24
- api/products?category={category}&limit=24
- api/categories/{category}
- api/products/sale
See readme for full specs

The app I built has 3 parts. The first is the login section, which is needed to access the rest of the app.
The second part is a catalog of the stores products, divided into categories and sub categories.
The last part is a barcode scanner that can be used to find a product's information by scanning its barcode. A user can also manually enter the barcode.
